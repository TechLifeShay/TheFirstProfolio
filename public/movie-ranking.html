<h1>The Best Movies According to Shay</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Scarface</h3>
<p>A classic. Really motivates the rags to riches theme. I believe everyone wants to have the world in their hand .</p>
<h3>Menance to Society</h3>
<p>It's a classic hood movie growing up. Jada pinkett Smith is beautiful and highlights her career in this movie.</p>
<h3>Game of Thones</h3>
<p>This is really a t.v show, But I have yet to see anything like it. The best ever!</p>
